    ## LSTM Model Architecture

    The model uses a sophisticated LSTM architecture with attention mechanism:

    1. **Input Layer**
       - 30-day sequence of 8 technical features
       - Features include: Returns, Volatility, High-Low Range, Volume Change, Price Momentum, Volume Momentum, BB Position, MA5

    2. **LSTM Layers**
       - First LSTM block (256 units): Trend recognition
       - Second LSTM block (128 units): Market pattern analysis
       - Third LSTM block with attention: Focus on important time steps
       - All LSTM layers use return_sequences=True for temporal pattern preservation

    3. **Attention Mechanism**
       - Custom AttentionLayer for focusing on significant time steps
       - Helps model identify critical patterns in the sequence

    4. **Dense Layers**
       - 256-unit dense layer with ReLU activation
       - 128-unit dense layer with ReLU activation
       - Output layer: 5-day price predictions

    5. **Regularization**
       - Batch Normalization after each major layer
       - Dropout (0.2) for preventing overfitting
       - L2 regularization (1e-4) on weights

    6. **Training Features**
       - Custom VolatilityAwareLoss function
       - Adam optimizer with gradient clipping
       - Mixed precision training
       - JIT compilation for performance

    ## Data Management

    The application uses SQLite database for efficient data management:

    1. **StockData Table**
       - Stores historical OHLCV data
       - Caches data to reduce API calls
       - Indexed by symbol and date

    2. **Prediction Table**
       - Stores model predictions
       - Tracks prediction accuracy
       - Enables historical analysis

    ## Setup

    ### Backend

    1. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    2. Start the FastAPI server:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    python main.py
    ```

    ### Frontend

    1. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    ```

    2. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    The frontend will be available at http://localhost:5173

    ## Usage

    1. Train a model for a specific stock:
    ```bash
    python train.py --symbol SYMBOL

    Pretrained Modules: AAPL, NVDA, NFLX, SOFI, UL, INAB, TM, MSFT, TSLA, and GOOGL
    ```


    2. Access the web interface at http://localhost:5173
    3. Enter a stock symbol (e.g., AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT)
    4. Click "Predict" to get 5-day price predictions

    ## Model Management

    To manage models and metrics:

    ```bash
    # Train a new model
    python train.py --symbol SYMBOL

    # Clear existing model files
    Remove-Item models\SYMBOL_*

    # Clear existing metric files
    Remove-Item metrics\SYMBOL_*
    ```
